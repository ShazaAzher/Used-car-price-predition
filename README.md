# Purchase Price Prediction for Used Cars 

Welcome to the Purchase Price Prediction for Used Cars Using Deep Learning project! In this project, we'll explore the sales data of used cars, create visualizations using seaborn, and build a deep learning model using TensorFlow to predict the estimated amount customers would spend to buy a used car.

## Overview

This project aims to predict the purchase price of used cars based on various attributes such as mileage, year of manufacture, brand, etc. We'll start by exploring the dataset using Seaborn for data visualization. Then, we'll preprocess the data, address missing values, and convert categorical variables into numerical representations for seamless processing.

Next, we'll build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras. The model will consist of several dense layers with suitable activation functions, and a linear activation function will be used in the output layer to predict continuous sale prices. We'll compile the model with an optimal optimizer, mean squared error loss function, and mean absolute error as a metric for evaluation.

After training the model, we'll test its performance using the testing data to determine how accurately it predicts the sale prices. Finally, we'll evaluate the model's accuracy using the R2 score.
